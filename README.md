# Stress dataset
Multimodal biosignals, facial videos and body pose dataset for stress recognition

## Aim
This dataset aims to investigate stress response to multiple stressors based on patterns in biosignals, facial videos, and body pose.


## Experimental Procedure

## Experimental Tasks
An experimental protocol was designed and conducted to investigate facial/physiological responses in stress conditions. The experiment included neutral tasks (used as reference) and stressful tasks in which stress conditions were simulated and induced employing different types of stressors. These stressors were categorized into 4 different phases: 
*	social exposure
*	emotional recall
*	mental workload tasks
*	stressful videos presentation

## Dataset population
The dataset population was 58 adults (24 men, 34 women) aged 26.9 Â± 4.8 years. For each participant, 11 tasks were performed, among they were 
*	4 neutral 
*	6 stressed 
*	1 relaxed 

A neutral condition was presented at the beginning of each phase of the experiment. This condition was used as a baseline for the subsequent stressful tasks. 

##	Data recording
The data recorded for each patient include
*	Demographics (gender, age, family history, etc.)
*	Questionnaire data (STAI, PSS10, HADS, DERS)
*	Facial video
*	Body posture video
*	Biosignals
*	electrocardiogram (ECG)
*	electrodermal activity (EDA)
*	electromyogram (EMG)
*	breathing pattern (RSP)
*	speech
